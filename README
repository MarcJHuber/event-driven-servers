This is a collection of high-performance and scalable event-driven servers
(notably tac_plus-ng, tac_plus, ftpd, tcprelay). Please have a look at the
documentation for configuration details.

Bugs
====

Be prepared for issues. This is work-in-progress, so be prepared for unexpected bahavior. Don't use this in a production environment without testing. If it breaks, please file an issue. The non-helpful alternative would be to just keep the broken pieces, so please don't do that. 

Installation instructions
=========================

This software suite should compile quite fine on Linux, FreeBSD and OpenBSD.
Other platforms might be fine, too, but weren't recently tested.

Build environment
-----------------

Required tools:

- A supported C compiler, plus linker. LLVM is fine, GCC will work too (but might have issues with optimization, so that's disabled for now).
- GNU make (version 3.79.1, unpatched,  recommended, others may or may
  not work).
- Perl
- Various development header files and libraries

Compile & Install
-----------------

Please run "./configure --help". It will output a list of supported
options. Then run ./configure with the appropriate arguments. After
that, run "make" to start the compilation process and "make install"
to install the compiled binaries.

Example:

  ./configure tac_plus-ng
  make
  sudo make install

You may actually omit the "configure" step if you're content with
the default build options, which are to compile everything and to
use all optional features your system supports at first glance.

If you don't care for the optional features (TLS support, C-ARES,
others), just run

./configure --minimum tac_plus-ng
make
sudo make install

Documentation
=============

The distribution comes with documentation located in the
top-level "doc" director, and you can view it online at
https://www.pro-bono-publico.de/projects, too.

Support
=======

While I really appreciate that you're using the software I'd
very much prefer *not* to receive private support enquiries.

Please direct support queries to GitHub discussions to one of those:
