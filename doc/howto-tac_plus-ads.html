<h1>Mini-HowTo: Integrating TACACS+ with ActiveDirectory</h1>
<P><B><I>If you're starting from scratch: Please consider using <a class="lk" href="tac_plus-ng.html">tac_plus-ng</a> and have a look at <a class="lk" href="howto-tac_plus-ng-ads.html">The tac_plus-ng AD Integration HowTo</a> first.
<a class="lk" href="tac_plus-ng.html">tac_plus-ng</a> supports multi-group membership and direct evaluation of mmemberOf attributes.</I></B>
</p>
This page will give you a starting point. However, to use any of
the advanced <a class="lk" href="tac_plus.html">tac_plus</a> features you'll
really <i>have</i> to read the documentation.
<p>Having said that, the steps to get you up and running are:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>
<p>Download the distribution. It's available from
<a class="lk" href="https://github.com/MarcJHuber/event-driven-servers/">GitHub</a>:
<pre class = "screen">git clone https://github.com/MarcJHuber/event-driven-servers.git</pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>Compile the code:</p>
<pre class="screen">
cd event-driven-servers
./configure
make
</pre></li>
<li>
<p>Install the distribution. You'll probably have to do so as the
<tt>root</tt> user, so either</p>
<pre class="screen">
sudo make install
</pre>
or
<pre class="screen">
su
make install
exit
</pre>
will be required to make this work.</li>
</ol>
<p>At this point, <i>installation</i> is complete, but this was
indeed just the generic (and easy) part of these instructions.
What's still missing is the configuration file, plus a couple of
assorted ActiveDirectory entries:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>
<p>ActiveDirectory</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>AD doesn't permit anonymous LDAP queries. You should add a
dedicated account to your AD server, e.g. <tt>tacacs</tt> that
isn't a member of any group and has a fixed (non-expiring, not
changeable) password.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add TACACS+ specific user groups, e.g. <tt>tacacsadmin</tt> and <tt>tacacsguest</tt>, to
your AD server, and add users to those groups. A user cannot be in multiple TACACS+ groups, so he/she shouldn't be
member of more than one group starting with <tt>tacacs</tt>
(but you can bypass this requirement by using the <tt>nas default restriction</tt> configuration directive, see the TACACS+ documentation for that one).</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Copy the <A CLASS="lk" HREF="../tac_plus/extra/tac_plus.cfg-ads">sample configuration file</A> from the
your local <tt>/usr/local/lib/mavis/extra/</tt> directory to <tt>/usr/local/etc/tac_plus.cfg</tt>.
Again, you'll obviously need <tt>root</tt> privileges for that, but
I'll silently ignore this requirement for now:</p>
<pre class="screen">
cp /usr/local/lib/mavis/extra/tac_plus.cfg-ads /usr/local/etc/tac_plus.cfg
</pre></li>
<li>
<p>Edit <tt>/usr/local/etc/tac_plus.cfg</tt> with your favorite
editor. As a minimum, you'll have to modify the <tt>setenv</tt>
variables starting with <tt>LDAP_</tt> to match your local
environment. Feel free to modify other stuff, too.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The authentication backend requires a couple of Perl modules
which may or may not be already installed on your system. Run</p>
<pre class="screen">
/usr/local/lib/mavis/mavis_tacplus_ads.pl &lt; /dev/null
</pre>
If there's some error message saying <tt>Can't locate Net/LDAP.pm
in @INC</tt> you'll first have to install the <tt>Net::LDAP</tt>
Perl module. If there's any other error message you should abort
right here as this would be plainly out of the scope of this document.</li>
<li>
<p>Check whether there are any syntax errors in the configuration
file:</p>
<pre class="screen">
/usr/local/sbin/tac_plus -P /usr/local/etc/tac_plus.cfg
</pre>
If there are any errors, well, fix them.</li>
<li>
<p>Check whether communication with the AD server is
functional:</p>
<pre class="screen">
/usr/local/bin/mavistest -d -1 /usr/local/etc/tac_plus.cfg tac_plus TAC_PLUS someusername
</pre>
(replace <tt>someusername</tt> with one from any of the
<tt>tacacs</tt> groups)</li>
<li>
<p>That's it. Almost. If you want the daemon to start at boot time,
you should <i>probably</i></p>
<pre class="screen">
cp /usr/local/lib/mavis/extra/etc_init.d_tac_plus /etc/init.d/tac_plus
</pre>
and add the assorted links from a couple of <tt>init</tt>
directories. Some other launch mechanisms are supported, too, just
dig through <tt>/usr/local/lib/mavis/extra/</tt>, there are samples for
<tt>launchd</tt> and <tt>systemd</tt>.
<p>
If you've performed that last step (the etc_init.d copying thing), then
<pre class="screen">
/etc/init.d/tac_plus start
</pre>
should start the daemon. Or just call
<pre class="screen">
/usr/local/sbin/tac_plus /usr/local/etc/tac_plus.cfg
</pre>
directly.</li>
</ol>
<p>Again, reading the documentation for <a CLASS="lk" href=
"spawnd.html">spawnd</a>,
<a CLASS="lk" href=
"mavis.html">mavis</a> and
<a CLASS="lk" href=
"tac_plus.html">tac_plus</a>
is highly recommended.</p>
